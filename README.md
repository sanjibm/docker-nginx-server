This image contains Nginx with Gunicorn on top of Python3 docker image.
These two software are managed with Supervisor.

# Usage

## Running directly off DockerHub
To try out the image directy from DockerHub, pull the image with:
```
docker pull sanjibm/python-nginx:latest
```

and then run
```
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8000:80 sanjibm/python-nginx
```
## Running your own image

The entry point of your application must be named as **run.py**. Moreover, the instance in that file must be called **api**.
Also, by default the worker class used is Gevent.

You can include a custom Gunicorn configuration file into your application. By default the configuration file must be named as **gunicorn.config.py**

### Dockerfile example

Here is an example of a Dockerfile using that image :

```
FROM sanjibm/python-nginx:latest
LABEL maintainer="sanjibm2006@gmail.com"

# Copy the application
COPY . /api

# Install application requirements
RUN pip install -U pip
RUN pip install -r /api/requirements.txt
```

There is also a Flask demo application in the *api* folder of this repository.

### Build and run

First, build your image based on your Dockerfile.

```
docker build -t pyapi
```

Then, you can run a container like this :

```
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8000:80 pyapi
```

And finally access it with curl for instance :

```
curl localhost:8000
```
